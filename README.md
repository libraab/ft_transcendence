========================
Basic commands explained:
========================

git init -> This command is like your transformation sequence
it initializes your repository and prepares it for use.

git clone -> This is like summoning your familiar,
it creates a copy of an existing repository on your local machine, so you can work on it and make changes.

git add -> This command is similar, it adds changes you've made to your local repository
preparing them to be committed.

git commit -> This command creates a snapshot of your changes and adds them to your repository's history.

git push -> Once you've saved your changes, you want to share them with the world.
This command pushes your local changes to a remote repository, so others can see them.

===========================
Specific commands explained:
===========================

git branch -> This command creates a separate branch in your repository
allowing you to work on different versions of your code simultaneously.

git pull -> Sometimes, other people make changes to the repository that you need to incorporate into your local version.
This command pulls those changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local copy.
ps: always pull before you start working.

git stash -> This command hides or stores items to use later.
It allows you to temporarily store changes that you don't want to commit yet, but don't want to lose either.

git checkout -> This command is like a secret door that lets you enter your own private island.
It allows you to switch between different branches in your repository
so you can work on your code without disturbing your teammates.

git merge -> When you and your crewmates have all amassed your own separate hoards of code
this command helps you combine them into one unified treasure trove.
It merges changes from one branch into another, so you can all work together in harmony.

git rebase -> Sometimes, you need to rearrange your treasure trove to make it more efficient.
This command lets you reapply your changes on top of someone else's changes
so you can keep your codebase clean and organized.

git blame -> When something goes wrong, you want to find out who's responsible.
This command shows you who made changes to a file and when they made them, it's like detective work!
